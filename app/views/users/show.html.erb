<p align="center">If you have read horoscopes before, it was likely for your Sun sign...<br>
But did you know, you are likely to get a more accurate horoscope reading using your Ascendant sign?<br>
The Ascendant (also known as your <em>Rising Sign</em>) is the sign that was ascending on the eastern horizon at your exact moment of birth!<br><br>

Not to worry though, you can still read for your Sun sign too - a lot of astrologers even recommend reading for both signs.<br>
Experiment and see what works for you!<br><Br></p>
